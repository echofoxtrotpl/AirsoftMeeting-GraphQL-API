# AirsoftMeeting API

My first attempt to make GraphQL API for Airsoft Meeting. Right now it has been replaced with different implementation and technologies so I can freely share this approach.

This project is based on .NET 5 Web API with usage of JWT authorization, Hot Chocolate, EF Core and Image Sharp.

It covers:

* JWT authorization
* EF Core integration with PostgreSQL database
* GraphQL integration using Hot Chocolate
* Image upload service using Image Sharp
* Background services for maintenance and filesystem/database cleaning

Actual version of AirsoftMeeting can be found [here](https://airsoftmeeting.pl)
